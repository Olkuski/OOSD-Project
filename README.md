The software is our personal take on the popular 70/80s game ‘Asteroids’
It is a simple game in which the player controls the avatar (rocketship), using the mouse, to avoid/dodge the enemies (asteroids). The asteroids fall from the sky (top of the screen) and vary in size to create a more difficult gameplay
If the player comes in contact with an asteroid, the game is over
The score is calculated by amount of seconds the player is alive
The longer the player stays alive, the higher the score
